# C Example Programs (Easiest to Hardest)

The `examples/` directory collects small C programs that increase in complexity as you move through the files. Each program can be compiled with `gcc <file.c> -o <output>` and run with `./<output>`.

1. `00_hello_world.c` — Print a greeting.
2. `01_sum_numbers.c` — Read numbers from standard input and calculate their sum.
3. `02_factorial_recursive.c` — Compute a factorial using recursion and basic error handling.
4. `03_file_word_count.c` — Open a text file, count words, and handle file I/O errors.
5. `04_linked_list.c` — Build and traverse a singly linked list using dynamic memory allocation.
6. `05_matrix_multiplication.c` — Multiply two matrices read from input with runtime dimension checks.
